This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

There you will find the excellent readme that you get automatically when using it.

* The project was [bootstrapped for typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) with the command `create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`
* In order to not look super-ugly, [bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) is used as css skeleton.

You can start the application with `yarn start` or `npm run start`.
